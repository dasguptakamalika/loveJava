/*

`head` is just pointing to the **first node [1]**. That's it.

---

**Inside addLast, `current` does all the moving:**
```
head →    [1] → [12] → [34] → null
current →  [1]                          // Start here

current →        [12]                   // Moved here

current →               [34]            // Moved here, stopped


Only current moved. head stayed.
Think of it like two people standing in a line:

head = standing at the front, never moves
current = walks to the back of the line

head doesn't care what current is doing. It just stays at the front. */
