In this Java code, we're seeing how object references work with shared memory. 
When Box shared = new Box(10) executes, it creates a single Box object in memory with value 10. 
Then when the Player constructor runs with this.box = box, it's not creating a new Box object - instead,
it's copying the reference (memory address) that points to that same Box object. So now we have three variables: 
shared, box (the parameter), and p.box that all contain the exact same memory address pointing to the one and only
Box object that was created. This is why when we later change shared.value = 99, we're modifying the value inside that 
single Box object in memory, and when we access it through p.box.value, we see the updated value of 99. 
All three variables are essentially different names for the same object - like having multiple remote controls that all operate the same TV.
 
class Box {
    int value;
Box(int v) 
{ 
value = v; 
}
}
class Player {
    String name;
    Box box;                 // reference to another object
    Player(String name, Box box) {
        this.name = name;    // set my name
        this.box = box;      // store the SAME Box reference (sharing)
    }
}
public class S9 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Box shared = new Box(10);
        Player p = new Player("Kamalika", shared);
        shared.value = 99;                 // change the shared object
        System.out.println(p.box.value);   // 99 (same object)
    }
}
